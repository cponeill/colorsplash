colorsplash
===========

A simple processing script that enables anyone with an Android phone to drag colored ellipses across the screen. Pretty simple code and I'm putting this up here for the fun of it. I may or may not come back to it at some point in the near future. I think this would be really cool to add sounds each time the device screen is touched. I would also like to add that that this could be seen as a terrible abstract painting.
